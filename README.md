A Tamil scripture reading application produced by the team at [Food For New Creature](https://foodfornewcreature.com/).

## About the App

Volume 2 is a digital scripture reading application that presents "The Time is at Hand" in Tamil. This volume explores the chronology of the Bible and helps readers understand where we are in the stream of time. It presents scriptural and historical evidence for the birth of Jesus in B.C. 2, offers insights indicating that we are already in the "Day of the Lord," and highlights how the Lord is actively working in the world in preparation for the coming kingdom.

These and other profound truths are carefully presented, making this volume a valuable resource for every earnest Bible student.
